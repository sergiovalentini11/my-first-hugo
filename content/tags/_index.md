I'm a guitarist and songwriter in the indie rock band Lunar Hotel (that's me on the right). [Check us out on Spotify here](https://open.spotify.com/artist/06roDvV3WD6b4RBldOYsIC).

You can also watch [a set we played at Subterranean in Chicago here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfa8xKDXTJI).

I've composed music scores for several local comedy sketch groups. Check out [Drive-Thru by the comedy group Schmoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlOldcGLfUw), a short sketch about falling in love at the drive-thru window.
